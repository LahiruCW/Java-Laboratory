The Algorithm for calculatePayable() Method
parameters: Vehicle[]

This method must be implemented in the main driver program
for the easy implementation I seperate this method to seperate methods


totalPaymentsWant()
1. iterate through the Vehicle List
2. call the calculateTotalPayment(getRequestedStatus)
3. store it in a static totalPayments variable


4. iterate through the statusCompleteMap[][]
5. //check the condition
6. create a new array with row values // completed status row
7. pass it to the calculateTotalPayments()
8. store the value in static variable totalNeed
